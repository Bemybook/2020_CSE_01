OPTICAL CHRACTER RECOGNITION

OCR stands for "Optical Character Recognition." It is a technology that recognizes text within a digital
image. It is commonly used to recognize text in scanned documents and images.
OCR software can be used to convert a physical paper document, or an image into an accessible 
electronic version with text. For example, if you scan a paper document or photograph with a printer, 
the printer will most likely create a file with a digital image in it. The file could be a JPG/TIFF or PDF, but the new electronic file may still be only an image of the original document. You can then load this
scanned electronic document it created, which contains the image, into an OCR program. The OCR 
program which will recognize the text and convert the document to an editable text file.
